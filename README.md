#The scotus case took almost two hours to generate the three temp pickle files and the assembly file, maybe my computer is too old..
## I'm having trouble, though, to publish the local repository to github. Temperarily only used Github's file upload button..

#scotus codes run, working on myself, got the right number as output in supcourt_yearlist.pickle
#In [2]: probably import two scientific packages called respectively pandas and numpy, and give them shorter names for easy reference.

#In [4]: assign the URL of SCOTUS to the variable "root_URL" as the source.

#define a range of 1760-2018 and assign this to the variable "years", then define a cycle with the single variable "year" traversing the range "years".
#define an output table structure and ask for the first five lines as the initial output, to check if the format is right.
#use the scotus docket number in the first line of the output to reverse-check the URL.

## The code looks to me as if importing several ready-to-use algorithm module from tensorflow's database, and apply the variable e.g., "year" defined in the scotus context to the existing variable in TF's corresponding variable.

## It seems that the existing sets of stopwords are used, and they are supplemented by a few other stopwords like "plurality of female/male names".

##lines 145-150: It seems the model are often verified with a few sample values before being applied to the whole dataset. I suppose this is because running through the whole dataset is too time-consuming, so developers had better make sure the model works before the actual running through.

##line 263: the try function could be sort of similar as "if" function.
